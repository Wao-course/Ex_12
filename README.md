# Lecture 12 exercises

## Exercise 12.1

In groups of 5-9 visit [this Miro board](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/UHpsT05sWURBUk5QN2ZUUjlvcnB6amxVbEJwRHRoOTBnVkxrNFNBS245WkIxUjNLNzNrV1oyTjNuRUQ3N0JYZHwzNDU4NzY0NTY0NzA0Njg5MjY5fDI=?share_link_id=928752745611), this is a workshop based Kata about DDD, which we will use parts of today.

1. Choose a group number 1-8 and 'reserve' the board quiz in the Miro board

1. Start by looking at the domain - the description and event [storm board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming), this corresponds to **Part 1**.
There are a quiz to help verify that the whole group have the same idea about the domain.
This should take around 15-25 minutes.

1. Move to the **Part 2** of the workshop.
    * Determine (stil in groups) which events are pivotal events.
    * Use pivotal events to determine boundaries

1. Use the Sam Newmans communication styles to determine how each boundary should get needed data and/or send request/data to other boundaries.
Result of this should be a diagram of your bounded contexts
